def get_action_matcher_prompt() -> str:
    return """
You are a clinical action matcher for ICU evaluation. For each predicted action, determine whether it semantically matches:
1) Ground Truth recommended actions
2) Ground Truth red-flag actions

## Match if:
- Same clinical intent and direction (increase/decrease/initiate/discontinue)
- Synonymous drugs within the same class used interchangeably (e.g., "norepinephrine" vs "noradrenaline")
- Different phrasings of the same action (e.g., "start vasopressors" vs "initiate norepinephrine")
- Abbreviations and full forms (e.g., "NE" vs "norepinephrine", "MAP" vs "mean arterial pressure")
- Active vs passive voice for the same action (e.g., "increase FiO2" vs "FiO2 was increased")

## Do not match if:
- Opposite directions (e.g., increase vs decrease)
- Different intervention categories (e.g., fluid bolus vs vasopressor)
- Hold vs wean vs discontinue (clinically distinct)

## Input
Predicted actions:
{predicted_actions}

Ground Truth Recommended actions:
{oracle_recommended_actions}

Ground Truth red-flag actions:
{oracle_red_flag_actions}

## Output
For each predicted action, list the indices of GT actions it matches for each target list independently.
Respond only with JSON:
{
  "recommended_action_matches": [
    {"pred_idx": 0, "gt_indices": [...]},
    {"pred_idx": 1, "gt_indices": [...]},
    ...
  ],
  "red_flag_matches": [
    {"pred_idx": 0, "gt_indices": [...]},
    {"pred_idx": 1, "gt_indices": [...]},
    ...
  ]
}

## Important Notes
A predicted action may match zero, one, or multiple actions in each target list.
